# MaterialDesignInXaml-Mod
An modified version of MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit, used for my player.

## Modified:
- Transitioner animation (Slide)
- Use fade-in and out instead while open and close dialog
- Ripple animation (Bug-Fixes and make faster animation)
- Round corner card increased to 8px
- Progressbar more like android (except circle style, I can't implement it)
- etc. (I don't remember what I modified sorry about that)
